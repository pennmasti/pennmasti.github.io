Despite his phenomenal skill set, he is one of the nicest and most humble people you can meet. You can find him on the court at Pottruck taking care of scrubs, doing nursing homework at the booths, or birding across Locust Walk trying (and succeeding) to get some ladies.

Ashwin, or as we call him, Shwindaddy, Shweiner, or Shwinny, is nothing less than a modern renaissance man. Ashwin does everything from raas to bhangra to filmy and he can't get enough of any of them because he loves to dance! If there was a dance team for each one, he would probably join all of them. His multifaceted talents aren't only on stage, however. He's also an aspiring triple major LSM student! And although he may look cute and cuddly on the outside, when he takes his shirt off, all the girls (and probably a few of the guys) will come running. Everyone on Masti knows that without a little Ashwin around to spice things up, our lives would be like a broken pencil-- pointless."},{id:"NeelKoyawala","class":2015,firstName:"Neel",lastName:"Koyawala",thumb:t(85),bio:"insert bio here"},{id:"MithinThomas","class":2015,firstName:"Mithin",lastName:"Thomas",thumb:t(161),bio:"Mithin, aka Mittens and Mitts, is one of Masti's finest members.

Mithin is known to take very spontaneous cab rides all across Philly to see a movie, re-watch funny Youtube videos for hours, and go HAM at freestyling on the dance floor at parties. When he's not with Masti, you can find Mithin on stage showing off his Oscar-worthy acting skills in Vietnamese Student Association Cultural Show plays. He gets his inspiration from a few of the Shahrukh Khan movies he's checked off his \"Bollywood Must See\" bucket list. Mithin's dimpled smile will never fail to brighten your day.

Needless to say, Nisha is a high achiever all around who has a knack for attracting wanted (and unwanted) attention for her bad habit of standing like a flamingo. In fact, she is so nimble that she might walk down Locust and inadvertently kick her own forehead.

This girl has an incredible ability to pick up literally any dance style from bhangra to modern lyrical and look like she's been trained in all of them for years.  She brings out her Cali swag in practice with her thizzing and insertion of hella into every phrase. Outside of Masti, you'll see her playing with her science models or volunteering at the local free clinic on her path to becoming Dr. Raje. We're so grateful that our little E.T. was able to \"phone home\" and join our Masti family because it wouldn't be the same without her."},{id:"NehaGarg","class":2015,firstName:"Neha",lastName:"Garg",thumb:t(164),bio:"Neha Garg (also known fondly as Gargy, Guppy, or Gargasaurus) is Masti’s very own Bollywood queen.

Shaun is a clear natural at bhangra, but he also has a hidden love of filmy. He has been caught dancing at all hours of the day and night, and he also enjoys watching Bollywood dances on YouTube (cough cough Jalebi Bai). Shaun is kind-hearted, fun, and charming, and it’s no surprise that the ladies come to Masti tryouts just to meet him.

You can find hundreds drooling over her Facebook cooking albums and her renowned baked treats, while you can find others awestruck by the intricacy and beauty of her artwork. Don’t be completely misled by this innocent and cute image of her – she knows how to bring it on stage! With the fiercest stank face and the flirtiest looks, she amazes the audience in all styles of dance. Busting out in bhangra, courting boys in filmy, rocking her swag in hip-hop, and triple-speeding bharatnatyam are just the beginnings of what you’ll see of this girl on stage. Off stage, you’ll see her training hard at the gym, writing multiple papers in the infamous Rodin booths, and teaching kids how to dance through CityStep, all while keeping her fashionable look together. A true friend that never fails in her ability to listen, to love, and to be loyal, Jananas has one of the best hearts you’ll ever find!"},{id:"AkashKumar","class":2014,firstName:"Akash",lastName:"Kumar",thumb:t(131),bio:"You know how SRK is the King of Bollywood? Here on Masti, we bow down to a different King. His name is Akash Kumar, or as we sometimes call him, Kash ($ for short). If you've ever seen him dance, you'll understand why. Whether he's sweeping you off your feet while he dances Bollywood style to some old classics, shaking his thang during hip hop pieces, or using his unbelievably long arms (seriously, sometimes you get hit if you stand too close) to do a kick-ass \"bird\" while doing bhangra, Akash steals the show. Off the dancefloor, he prefers to stray far from his flashy stage attire, and instead opts for his signature Masti T-shirt and sweatpants. Any hour of the day, you are likely to find him like this, lounging on a couch somewhere, computer in his lap, coding new websites or cramming for one of his numerous classes (...or maybe just watching dance videos on YouTube!). But besides all of this, what really makes Akash a star is that he is as lovable, if not more lovable, than the King of Bollywood himself.

Offstage, he can be found studying for his classes, playing volleyball, ordering the 5-star spicy drunken noodles from Thai Singha, or just falling asleep while skyping. Contrary to his nickname, Poops is all about the hygiene and is in Penn's 7-year Biodental program. Though he is actually one of Masti's busiest members, constantly going from classes to practices to meetings to research labs, he manages to make it all seem easy and always has time for his friends when we need him. In our beloved Poopy, Masti has found not only an amazing dancer and personal future dentist, but also one of the most fun-loving and understanding friends anyone could have."},{id:"SamirDevalaraja","class":2014,firstName:"Samir",lastName:"Devalaraja",thumb:t(179),bio:"Samir is the most interesting man in the world.

Trisha is probably one of the only people you'll ever meet that is involved in literally everything at Penn, but does every single thing wholeheartedly and still has time on top of that to have a good time. She puts in hours on end to make sure Masti has the sickest choreo for literally any genre of dance: from filmy to classical to classical krump to bachata to our personal favorite, the peacock. But it's not just her moves that make us love Trisha...it's her amazingly idiotic laugh, her inner party animal, her ability to do every ridiculous dance move with no shame, her confidence to tell the world about her pants falling off at her first Masti practice, her inability to tell stories well, and most importantly her 24/7 availability to be there as a friend. No matter when you need her or what you need her for Trisha is the one person you can count on to support you, give you advice, or just make you laugh.

It’s no wonder that she earned her nickname “Sassy Shikha.” Apart from that, with a background in ballet, jazz, and hip-hop, Shikha not only brings the sexy to Masti but also the weird. At any given hour, you can probably find her giggling as she studies eating or human anatomy. If you ever need a late night snack run, you can be sure that Shikha is awake and probably hungry. In the dance studio, Shikha is known for posing for obscure amounts of time in front of the mirror (not that any of us mind of course) while the rest of us sweat to death trying to remember choreography that Shikha picks up in minutes! While she’s simply breathtaking on and off the dance floor, she always makes time being an amazing friend and a big sister ready to sit down and have a late night heart-to-heart. However, the best thing about Shikha is how unbelievably friggin’ cute she is (seriously, her voice never goes below a certain octave)!

Quite honestly, this is the weirdest guy you will ever meet. From describing rainbows as “orgasm color bows” to using nipple twists as “hellos”, Ammar might be weird but no one on Masti can deny that he’s also wickedly brilliant. With a keen eye for detail and an immeasurable amount of experience working with music, it’s thanks to Ammar that Masti’s music cuts may be replaying in your head over and over again. Apart from that, with his amazing stage presence and a smile that will light up the world, it’s almost impossible to keep your eyes off him on and off the dance floor.  The sheer amount of energy and versatility that he brings to the table is sure to get you dancing in your seat (if you aren’t already dancing alongside him ;). But the reason why Masti loves Ammar is his capability to be the best “bruuaaahhh” you could ever have! As the most genuine and nicest person you could ever meet, you can be sure that Ammu will be there for you with an incredible expanse of wisdom, experience, and love that Masti just can’t get enough of.
